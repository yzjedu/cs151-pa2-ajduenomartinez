### Objective
#### What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?
In this PA we were meant to create a game in which user inputted how many players between 1 and 2, user inputted how many sticks they 
wished to pick from, and how many sticks they wished to take on their turn.

### Procedure
#### What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?
1. First I created an algorithm for the program, so I could better visualize how I was going to go about writing the code.
2. Then I created the code for the program after carefully considering how I was going to create it.

#### What were the key concepts explored?
The key concepts explored in this PA were the use of while loops and the random module

### Reflection
#### What challenge did you encounter?
The biggest challenge I encountered was creating while loops that included all the criterai for error checking.

#### How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?
I created the algorithm before coding, I made sure to make the variables readable and included comments in the code to 
ensure human readability, and I practiced with while loops in the previous labs.

#### Did you overcome them and how?
I overcame the challenges by researching how to utilize .isdigit in the program.
#### Any Key takeaways?
The biggest takeaway for this lab is that typecasting is incredibly important, and whole programs can stop working due to one
variable being typecasted incorrectly.

#### Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?
I think I fully understand how to create while loops that can fit multiple criteria.
